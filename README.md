# Nurani_Qaida

The project is about developping a web application called "My enligthned rule" based on machine learning using different libraries of python.<br/>
We inspired the idea of the project from a mobile application "Noorani_Qaida" present on google play.<br/>
Its main goal is to  give the user a tool to learn reading arabic(Alphabets,words of various categories..) using voice recognition .<br/>
The user of the application  tries to read each word or alphapet.<br/>
Then,the system shows him if the spelling is correct , incorrect or almost correct.After every correct answer,the score is increased.
