# Nurani_Qaida

The project is about a web application called "My enligthned rule".It's developed using machine learning.
We inspired from a web application "Noorani_Qaida"
Its main goal is to  give the user a tool to learn reading arabic(Alaphabet another categories..) using voice recognition.
The user of the application  tries to read each word or alphapet.
The system shows him if he is correct or incorrect or almost correct.With each correct answer ,his score increases.
